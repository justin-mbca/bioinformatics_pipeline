## üöÄ Quick Start

### Bulk RNA-Seq Pipeline (Snakemake)

1.  **Set up the environment:**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate your virtual environment
    ```

2.  **Run the entire pipeline:**
    ```bash
    snakemake --snakefile workflows/Snakefile --cores 1 --printshellcmds
    ```
    *Outputs will be generated in the `rna_seq/` directory.*

### Single-cell RNA-Seq Demo (Seurat)

1.  **Navigate to the scRNA-seq directory and run the analysis:**
    ```bash
    cd scrna_seq
    Rscript scrna_seq_analysis.R
    ```
    *Results (plots, markers, Seurat object) will be saved in `scrna_seq/results/`.*

## üî¨ Pipeline Details

### 1. Bulk RNA-Seq Analysis

A Snakemake-managed pipeline for differential expression analysis.

**Workflow Overview:**
```mermaid
graph LR
A[Raw Counts] --> B[Preprocessing & QC];
B --> C[DESeq2 Analysis];
C --> D[Results Annotation];
C --> E[MA Plot];
D --> F[Volcano Plot];
```

**Steps:**
1.  **Preprocessing & QC** (`preprocess_qc.py`): Loads `sample_counts.csv`, performs QC, and outputs a cleaned matrix and library size plot.
2.  **Differential Expression** (`deseq2_analysis.R`): Runs DESeq2 to identify DEGs. Outputs results and an MA plot.
3.  **Annotation** (`annotate_results.py`): Merges results with `gene_annotation.csv` for biological context.
4.  **Visualization** (`volcano_plot.py`): Generates a volcano plot from the annotated results.

### 2. Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis

A Seurat-based pipeline for analyzing scRNA-seq data.

**Steps include:**
*   Data loading (10x Genomics format supported)
*   Quality control and filtering
*   Normalization and feature selection
*   Dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP)
*   Clustering and marker gene identification
*   Visualization (UMAP plots, feature plots)

**Demo Data:** A synthetic 10x-style dataset (500 genes x 50 cells) is provided in `scrna_seq/data/demo_10x/` to test the pipeline.

## üß† Integration Strategy: Bulk & Single-Cell

A key strength of this framework is the ability to integrate findings across data modalities.

1.  **Independent Analysis:** Run bulk and single-cell pipelines separately to get DEGs and cluster markers.
2.  **Comparative Analysis:** Overlap DEGs from bulk with marker genes from single-cell to identify which cell types drive population-level changes.
3.  **Deconvolution:** Use single-cell data as a reference (e.g., with CIBERSORTx) to estimate cell type proportions in bulk samples.
4.  **Cross-Validation:** Validate bulk findings by confirming DEG expression in specific cell clusters from the single-cell data.

*This integrated approach provides a more complete biological narrative, linking population-level changes to their cellular origins.*

## üß™ Methods Overview

| Analysis Type | Key Tools | Primary Methods |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bulk RNA-Seq** | DESeq2, Snakemake | Negative binomial GLM, Wald test, FDR correction |
| **Single-Cell RNA-Seq** | Seurat | Log-normalization, HVG selection, PCA, graph-based clustering, Wilcoxon rank-sum test |

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

This repository is designed for extensibility. Planned enhancements include:
*   **Multi-omics Integration:** Support for proteomics, metabolomics, and ATAC-seq data.
*   **Advanced Visualization:** Enhanced interactive dashboards for integrated data exploration.
*   **Cloud/HPC Support:** Scale analyses on cloud platforms and high-performance clusters.
*   **Automated Reporting:** Generate comprehensive HTML/PDF reports for sharing insights.
*   **Parameter Sweeps:** Tools for automated large-scale batch analysis and optimization.
